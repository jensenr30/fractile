The purpose of this file is to draw fractals.
This is accomplished with the SDL2 graphics library.
The "graphics.c" and "graphics.h" files are utilized in order to draw lines, shapes, and other things on the screen.
These lines and shapes are the building blocks of the fractals drawn here.

#define fst_pixel			1	// this draws a pixel at <x[0],y[0]>
#define fst_circle			2	// this draws a circle with center <x[0],y[0]> and a radius of the [radius] variable
#define fst_tri				3	// this uses <x[0],y[0]>, <x[1],y[1]>, and <x[2],y[2]> as points to specify a triangle.
